## üçº Introduction
When experimenting or changing banners on LinkedIn, I don't think there is a way to preview the profile with the changes unless the changes are physically accepted. Therefore I created the LinkedIn Profile Previewer. The web application enables users to produce a replication of their LinkedIn profile header. This gives users the opportunity to test different headshots and banner designs before applying the changes to their actual LinkedIn profile.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Users can choose headshot and banners they want to view on the profile mockup.
- Users can enter simple LinkedIn information to replicate their profile 
- Toggle between light and dark mode on the profile card 
- Web application is accessible on mobile and desktop
